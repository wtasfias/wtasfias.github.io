        <p> At 3:00AM, your eyes snap open. Your fellow code day students are all sound asleep. You hear a door creak prompting you to open your eyes. All that can be seen is the dim light peering through your window. Then suddenly, a piercing beam of light cuts through the air. Frantically, you look around and snores are still prominent in the room. You see a treacherous slim man in a bomber jacket tiptoeing with vigilance. What do you do?</p>
