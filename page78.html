        <p id = "text"> You admit in shame that you were placed in bronze 4, and you look at the ground to avoid eye contact. The man finally steps out of the shadows. He is wearing an apron with the words “hehe xd” written across it. He slowly says, “That’s ok, I’m glad to finally meet another fellow bronzie. I will promise to boost you to bronze 3, as long as you become my friend :).” You are dumbfounded. How could this man be so friendly and so fashionable at the same time? You two duo queue all night, and after 342 ranked games, you eventually do indeed end up climbing to bronze 3. Moral of the story is: when in fear, play league. </p>
