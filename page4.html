        <p>You scream at the man to stop disturbing your sleep. Somehow, no one wakes, and the man slowly turns and stares at you. He has the face of a monster(add imaqtpie image), and his glare petrifies you. He slowly advances to you, and you feel the fear seep into your veins. You see the man pull out something from his pocket that is black and metallic. What do you do?</p>
