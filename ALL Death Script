He catches up with ease, and you think to yourself “maybe I shouldn’t have played those 342 ranked games, and instead did something with my life.” He coughs out a laugh, and pulls out a dual barreled 1984 vintage shotgun from his pocket. As he pulls the trigger, you hear a small chuckle and a tiny whisper, “Fuckin’ bonobo.” You Died')

<script>
function myFunction() {
    alert('As you slowly pull your shirt up, the man gives you a death stare. He continues to raise his hand from his pocket, but instead of pulling out something metallic, he lifts up his shirt simultaneously. You see the rock hard six pack under his shirt, and realize that you fucked up. He continues his approach, and tosses his shirt into the group of sleeping students, as if they were his fans. He then pulls out the contractible grenade launcher from his pocket, and looks straight at you. The last thing you hear is him muttering under his breath, “Fuckin’ bonobo.” He giggles like a little girl, and pulls the trigger. You Died')

    alert('You beg him, whimpering, “Don’t harm me, please!” He simply laughs at you and pulls out a .22 Indianapolis colt. All of a sudden, you feel a sharp pain through your neck. As you slowly bleed away, you hear a faint laugh and a whisper, “Fuckin’ boosted animal.” You Died')

function myFunction() {
    alert('He laughs. “B-B-Bronze? And you w-w-want to d-d-duo with me-e-e?” All of a sudden, his stuttering stops and he steps into the light, revealing a 6 foot 5 figure dressed in full Draven gear. He throws a life-sized metal axe at you, cutting a large gash through your stomach and bleeding you out. He laughs, and as you slowly lose consciousness, the words “hehe xd” appear in your mind for the last time.You Died')

You lose track of time and end up with incomplete masteries, which results in you feeding and losing the game. Trembling with anger, the man flings his assortment of rainbow didlos and you get smothered to death. You Died')
