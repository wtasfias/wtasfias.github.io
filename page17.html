        <p id="text">As you pull out your computer, trying to ignore his daunting presence, you accidentally look up and make eye contact. He stares at your screen and watches you like a hawk as you nervously shake your mouse onto the little “play” button on the top of the screen. Out of the corner of your eye, you see him reach him into his right pocket, pulling out a black, metallic object. What do you do?
