        <p> As you slowly pull your shirt up, revealing a flab because you played 342 ranked games, the man gives you a death stare. He continues to raise his hand from his pocket, but instead of pulling out something metallic, he lifts up his shirt simultaneously. You see the rock hard six pack under his shirt, and realize that you fucked up. He continues his approach, and tosses his shirt into the group of sleeping students, as if they were his fans. He then pulls out the contractible grenade launcher from his pocket, and looks straight at you. The last thing you hear is him muttering under his breath, “Fuckin’ bonobo.” He giggles like a little girl, and pulls the trigger. </p>
